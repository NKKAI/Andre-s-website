	<h1><i> Andre's Website </i></h1>

  <h4 id="About"> About </h4>

  <p id="P1"> This site will show up like a magazine, because I like to get new information about fashion, footwear, music, arts, design, tech, entertainment, gaming, automotive, food, travel, and sports. <br>

  Long times ago, I saw <a href="https://hypebeast.com/"> HYPEBEAST</a> website, and there are many catagories and many different type of news. So I want to make my website as HYPEBEAST as give many different types of informations for the people.<br>

  The reason why I interest in fashion, arts, and others were in grade 7, my homestay older brother was show me <i><strong>Supreme, Bape, Palace's</strong></i> clothes and at that time I fall into a fashion world. Also, my mom love art and she graduate art high school, so she teach me arts when I was kindergarden. Therefore, I naturally came to like artistic things (fashion, music, arts, design, tech, and etc..) </p>

  <h4 id="GettingStarted"> Getting started </h4>

  <p id="P2"> Already, a lot of people have been interested in fashion since 2016. Many people are still interested in fashion, and there are many students who want to grow into art such as models, fashion designers, musicians, etc.<br>
  
  Therefore, rather than worrying how many people are interested in my interests, I would like to use my website to inform them of my understanding of fashion, history, direction of pursuit, and so on. Also, I would like to explain various fields such as music, technology, etc. if possible with exceptions. </p>
